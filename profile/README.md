# HTTP Monitoring (httpmon)

## Introduction

Well, well, well, I have the same project in my repository named [HTTP_monitoring](https://github.com/elahe-dastan/HTTP_monitoring) which does exactly the same thing,
that project started to become larger and larger which was really hard to maintain that was when my friend and teacher
[Parham Alvani](https://github.com/1995parham) suggested to change the project to smaller microservices that were much
easier to maintain, here is how I want to break the project to smaller projects.
